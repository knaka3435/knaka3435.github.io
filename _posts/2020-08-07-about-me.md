My name is Kenji Nakagawa and I'm a student at Caltech who is double majoring in mathematics and computer science. In terms of math, I'm interested in number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory, and for CS, I'm interested in leveraging computational power in order to do mathematics. This leveraging takes a variety of forms: collecting data to generate conjectures for problems in a variety of topics such as [Young Tableaux](/ytcore/index.html) and knot theory (in a research project under [Alex Zupan](https://math.unl.edu/azupan2)) as well as formally verifying some [ring theory](/lean/index.html) in a proof assistant called [lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib).
