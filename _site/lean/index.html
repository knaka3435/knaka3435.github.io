    <h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>
<p>The goal of the project is to formalize some of the fundamental mathematics that is central to Algebraic Number Theory, mainly focusing on dedekind domains and the many, many equvialent definitions, some of which included looking at discrete valuation rings (which coincidentally has many, many equivalent definitions). Most of the filled-in proofs however, consist of statements about other things, but in doing so, provides a stronger foundation for the future.</p>

<p>Special thanks to my project advisor, Apurva Nakade, who has helped explain the math some of the APIs (with \(\varepsilon&lt;0\) documentation) are trying to capture, as well as answering a variety of questions from basic lean syntax to some really vague questions (left as comments in the code) that has made a proof magnitudes easier. Also without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Teaching Math to Computers</code> class, I would not doubt learning the basics of Lean would have taken much longer.</p>

<p>Also, big thanks to Jalex Stark, who has helped transform some really hacky solutions into rational ones, as well as providing insight as to how to properly do things (like instances) in Lean. Not to mention the monumental task of trying to optimize spaghetti code.</p>

<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>

<p>Here we deal exclusively with commutative rings with identity, as they are truth.</p>

<p>The localization of a ring at \(S\) is the set of all elements \(\{\frac{r}{s} \mid \ r \in R, \ s \in S \}\). The set \(S\) has some structure, which is that it is closed under multiplication (a multiplicative submonoid of R) and typically contains the multiplicative identity. An interesting result is that if \(0 \in S\), then the localization of \(R\) at \(S\) is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zero ring</code> which has only one element, \(0\), and this is due to the fact that \(0\) is assumed to be a unit, and the multiplication rule by \(0\) still applies.</p>

<p>Somewhat confusingly, the localization of \(R\) at a prime ideal \(P\) is actually the localization of \(R\) at \(R-P\), which is the set-theoretic complement of \(P\) (although the motivation is probably a mixture of laziness and wanting an interesting localization). If \(R\) is an integral domain, this results in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local ring</code> which has the property that the only nonzero prime ideal is \(P\), and is of particular interest to the theory of algebraic geometry (although this is beyond me). More importantly, one of the definitions of a dedekind domain is that the localization at any nonzero prime is a discrete valuation ring (which is a special type of local ring).</p>

<p>Another good property for rings to have, which makes them really nice is the Noetherian property, which yet again, has many definitions. Fortunately, they mainly manifest in the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For any chain of ideals, the inclusions \(I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 \subseteq I_4 \subseteq \ldots\) is eventually constant. In other words, there exists \(n\) such that \(I_{n-1} \subset I_n = I_{n+1} = \ldots\).</li>
  <li>Any ideal of \(R\) is finitely generated (as an \(R\)-submodule).</li>
  <li>Any nonempty set of ideals of \(R\) has a maximal ideal (not contained in any other ideal of the set).
One can analogously talk about Noetherian modules (here ideals get replaced by submodules).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="localizations-of-integral-domains">Localizations of integral domains</h3>
<p>The following is a proof that any nontrivial localization of an integral domain, \(R\), is yet another integral domain. Intuitively, this makes sense, as when we divide out by the things in \(S\), we do not introduce zero divisors (also here we require that \(0 \not\in S\), as otherwise this would break rule 4! Also the zero ring is not an integral domain, as there does exist at least two distinct elements).</p>

<p>In terms of equivalent Noetherian submodules, so far, Lean has a statement which is essentially the first is equivalent to the second, but the third is not included.</p>

<p>I have found a truly marvelous proof that if \(X\) is a module over \(R\), and for every set of submodules of \(X\), there exists a maximal submodule, then \(X\) is a Noetherian module, which the margins of this website is too small to contain.</p>

<h1 id="followup">Followup</h1>
<p>In the weeks following Mathcamp, I found that is was very hard to put Lean down, especially when I was so close to finishing up a few loose ends, and so I continued to work on it. Also, the ominous saying “whatever isn’t PRed into mathlib is forever lost” was a great motivator! And so, I made a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3846">pull request</a> that contained all of the finished work that I made (and was improved by the community by a lot!), and a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/mushokunosora-dedekind">branch</a> for everything else that hasn’t been tidied up (whose most recent accomplishment is the fact that every ideal in a dedekind domain contains some nonempty product of nonzero prime ideals).</p>

<h2 id="noetherian">Noetherian</h2>

<p>So the original lean proof is as follows, and it is essentially the following paper-pencil proof.</p>

<p>First, we wish to show that if any nonempty set of submodules has a maximal submodule, then it is finitely generated.
Let \(I\) be any submodule, consider the set \(S = \{ J \ \mid \ J \subseteq I, \ J \ \textrm{is finitely generated}\}\), this set has maximal submodule \(I\) (as otherwise, we can indefinitely keep on throwing in more generators), and since \(I \in S\), we have that \(I\) is finitely generated.</p>

<p>Now, for the converse, we actually use the equivalent definition that for every submodule, there does not exist an infinitely ascending chain of submodule inclusions. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that there is a nonempty set such that it does not have a maximal submodule, then we can start off with some element of that set, and choose some element that contains it (this is always possible, as there is no maximal element), but since we can do this indefinitely, we have constructed an infinitely ascending chain, a contradiction.</p>
