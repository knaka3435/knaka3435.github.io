# Hello, currently this website hasn't been fleshed out much, but check out the following page!

[Mathcamp 2020 Project - Ring theory in Lean](lean/index.html): The initial goal was to get somewhere in striking distance of proving quadratic reciprocity using the cycotomic fields and the splitting conditions, however, this proved to be extremely hard because, well... the crucial theorems haven't been proven, and the theorems were not able to be proven yet because the definitions they depend on haven't been formalized, and well, you get the idea. What ended up happening was that I found that instead of proving some really big theorems that were rather narrow in scope, I had to prove several lemmas that were more general, and in the process, found that I had to learn quite a few new things.
